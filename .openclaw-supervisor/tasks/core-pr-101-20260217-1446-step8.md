PR: #124
Head SHA: dd2ff76ce961d53ecc113b15e377f8ba776840e6
Review decision: CHANGES_REQUESTED
CodeRabbit unresolved threads: 6
CodeRabbit query failed: no
Remediation mode: ci
Current failing checks: Behat, Deptrac, Infection, PHPUnit, Psalm, Run Bats Suite (coverage-core), Run Bats Suite (coverage-negative), Run Bats Suite (general), Run Bats Suite (negative), Run Bats Suite (static-analyzes), Run Bats Suite (test-integration)
Current pending checks: Run Bats Suite (test-coverage)

Goal:

- Resolve required CI failures first (non-Bats first, Run Bats Core Tests last).
- Keep changes minimal and PHP 8.4-upgrade focused.
- Commit and push to the task branch when a fix is ready.

Constraints:

- Do not edit unrelated workflows or refactor.
- Do not expose secrets.
- Keep output concise and execution-focused.
