Feature: CustomerType Collection and Resource Endpoints with Detailed JSON Validations
  In order to ensure full compliance of the Core Service API responses for customer types
  As an API consumer

And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/problem+json; charset=utf-8"
And the response should be valid according to the operation id "api_customer_types_get_collection"
And the JSON node "detail" should contain "Page should not be less than 1"
