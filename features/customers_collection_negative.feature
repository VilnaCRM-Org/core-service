Feature: Customers Collection and Resource Endpoints with Detailed JSON Validations
  In order to ensure full compliance of the Core Service API responses
  As an API consumer
  I want to perform detailed validations on every endpoint (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) including negative cases

  Background:
    Given I add "Accept" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/ld+json"
