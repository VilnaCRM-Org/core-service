    # Serialization groups configuration for CustomerStatus entity

    # Group usage:
    # - 'output': Read-only in all REST and GraphQL output operations
    # - 'write:customerStatus': Writable in create/update operations
    #
    # GraphQL Operations:
    # - Query operations (e.g., customerStatus, customerStatuses) use 'output' group
    # - Create/Update mutations use 'write:customerStatus' group for input validation
    # - The 'ulid' field is intentionally read-only (auto-generated server-side)
    #   and not included in write operations to prevent modification
    ulid:
      groups: ['output']

    value:
      groups: ['output', 'write:customerStatus']
